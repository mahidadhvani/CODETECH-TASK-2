OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.
First, we need to prompt the user for the number of assignments and then ask for the grades of each assignment.
Next, we calculate the average grade and determine the corresponding letter grade based on a predefined grade scale.
Finally, we display the average grade and letter grade to the user.
